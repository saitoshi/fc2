                    Internship</h2>
                <h5 style="text-align: center;">Decemeber 2021</h5>
                <p>Abstract: In the last few decades, the importance of internships for a career development has
                    grown. However, the
                    difficulty to search through possible internships has not decreased. Undergraduate students are
                    forced to spend long
                    hours and use multiple job searching websites for internships. Furthermore, these websites do
                    not provide them with
                    internships that they fully qualify for. Thus, the Internaloha project provides an alternative
                    ”shortcut” for students
                    seeking internships. The approach of Internaloha is creating a scraper to extract Computer
                    Science internships from the
                    different job websites and have them integrated into RadGrad’s internship explorer page. The
                    goal for Internaloha
                    Version 2 is to recreate them using TypeScript and clean it up to look more efficient.</p>

                    Retention and Degree Success</h2>
                <h5 style="text-align: center;">August 2021</h5>
                <p>Abstract: In the last few decades, there has been a steady decline in the diversity of students
                    graduating with a Computer Science
                    degree. The RadGrad project tackles this issue by providing an alternative perspective to the
                    undergraduate degree
                    program. The approach in RadGrad is to make extracurricular activities equal in importance to
                    curricular activities when
                    designing a “well-balanced” degree plan. To accomplish this, RadGrad presents an alternative to GPA
                    with Innovation,
                    Competency, Experience points also known as MyI.C.E. In addition, RadGrad is designed to provide a
                    “knowledge base”
                    about the discipline including topic areas (called “Interests”) and Career Goals, Courses,
                    Opportunities, (and in the
                    near future), Internships. The goal for this summer is to make RadGrad v2.0 ready for deployment
                    into both the ICS
                    Department and the Computer Engineering program starting in Fall 2021. This summer, we participated
                    in the development
                    and evaluation of the second major version of RadGrad. So far, we improved the functionality of the
                    system, and made
                    progress on the integration of InternAloha, a plugin designed to help students find internships. In
                    addition, we
                    conducted a pilot study to investigate ways to improve the system based on real-life student
                    perspectives. The results
                    of the pilot study will be used to improve the design of the system, and include such findings as:
                    user experience
                    issues and the lack of incentive of some features. Through this experience we learned various skills
                    and techniques used
                    to develop a moderately-sized application and conduct meaningful software evaluations while focusing
                    on larger research
                    issues surrounding diversity in Computer Science.</p>
